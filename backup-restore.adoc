== Backup & restoration

WARNING: It is *HIGHLY* advised to only perform  backups and restorations of the database while the system is not being used!

=== Backing up the database

The backup program is intended to be used on a server with a libki user. 

A backup folder will be created in the libki user's home directory, where the backups are stored.

Please note that this will only create local backups. It is adviced to transfer them to a safe location. A guide on how to transfer automatic backups to an FTP server will be added later.

==== Make a backup manually

Simply run `libki-backup`.

The backup will be created and stored in `/home/libki/backups`. The file name will contain date and time for the backup for easier identifying, i. e. `db_180706_19.30.sql`.

==== Make automatic backups

The backup program features a silent mode, perfect for when you don't want any user input or text output. Run `libki-backup -s` to run it in silent mode.

Automatic backups work the same way as the manual backups, but does not provide any output text. The backup file is created directly in `/home/libki/backups`.

If you want to make backups automatically according to a schedule, this is easiest done through crontab. I won't go through how crontab works, but will provide some example schedules.

Start by running `crontab -e`. You will probably want to use the default editor. Add the schedule at the bottom of the file.

*Crontab examples*

Daily backup at 02:00:

[source,bash]
----
0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/libki-backup -s
----

Backup every Sunday evening:

[source,bash]
----
0 21 * * SUN /usr/local/bin/libki-backup -s
----

Backup the first date in every month at 01.15:

[source,bash]
----
15 1 1 * * /usr/local/bin/libki-backup -s
----

=== Backing up the server files

The easiest way to backup the server files is to tar the libki-server folder in the libki user's home folder. I suggest you put it in the same backup folder as the database backup.

[source,bash]
----
tar -pzcvf /home/libki/backups/libki-server-backup_190816.tar.gz /home/libki/libki-server
----

=== Restoring a database backup

Restoring a backup of the database will delete the current database, so be sure you really want to do this.

Start by navigating to the folder containing the backup you want to restore. If the backup was created with the backup program, this folder will be `/home/libki/backups`.

[source,bash]
----
cd /home/libki/backups
----

Now run the program and specify what backup you want to restore.

[source,bash]
----
libki-restore db_180706_19.30.sql
----

Your database is now at the point it was when the backup was created.

=== Restoring a backup of the server files

Start by removing the current server files and replace them with the backup archive.

[source,bash]
----
service libki stop
rm -rf /home/libki/libki-server
tar -pzxvf /home/libki/backups/libki-server-backup_190816.tar.gz /home/libki/libki-server
service libki start
